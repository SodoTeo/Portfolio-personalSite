						<h1>Yaay Hobies!</h1>
						<p>
							Hobbies often provide a creative outlet that you might not get in your everyday life.
							They allow you to do something that’s just for you, that can help you forget your
							daily problems, unwind after a hard day and give you a lot of pleasure! P.S. Wall Climbing 13m --->

						<h1>Prototyping</h1>
						<p>
							From digital and paper prototyping to rapid prototyping and high-fidelity
							prototyping (and many more in between), it’s crucial to know what might
							apply to any product. Finding the correct form of prototyping is the
							only way to execute ideas that are practical and viable to thrive in the real world.

						<h1>Travelling</h1>
						<p>
							“The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” – said Saint Augustine.
							Some of my most cherished memories are from the times when I was travelling. If you travel, 
							you can experience things that you could never experience at home. You may see beautiful places
							and landscapes that do not exist where you live. You may meet people that will change your life,
							and your thingking. You may try activities that you have never tried before.

						<h1>Anime</h1>
						<p>
							Anime is hand-drawn and computer 
							animation originating from Japan. In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the 
							English word animation), describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. 
							Outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers 
							specifically to animation produced in Japan.

						<h1>Cooking (not so often)</h1>
						<p>
							Studies have shown that baking and cooking help 
							relieve stress. “The actual act of cooking can be so therapeutic because it 
							involves things like rhythmic chopping or stirring,” certified eating psychology 
							and nutrition expert Elise Museles says. “And at the end of it, you have this 
							delicious meal, which is hugely rewarding, so there’s a sense of accomplishment, too.”
